		<p>Here you can contact me about any problems or questions you might have. I will check the email frequently and try to respond to everybody. Make sure you have a clear subject line and a well written body.</p>

		<p>Click <a href="mailto:jarvis.contact@gmail.com">here</a> to send me an email. Or, if you prefer to do it manually, the email adress is 'jarvis.contact@gmail.com'.</p>

		<p>You can also send us a message with more details about your program by using the 'report' command in JARVIS. This will call the tool report.exe which will ask you for a message and then if you want to send a copy of your settings file, your log file, and you custom commands. In order for us to benefit most from your report we recommend that you allow a copy of all of these things to be sent. It will allow us to see where the program should recieve the most attention and what direction we should go with further development. It also allows us to pinpoint errors or bugs in the program.</p>
