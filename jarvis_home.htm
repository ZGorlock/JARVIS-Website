		<h1>JARVIS</h1>
		<p>This is the homepage for JARVIS, an intelligent Digital Life Assistant, programmed in QB64 for use on Windows XP. It was made to be free and to help people with everyday computer tasks. Telling people about it I have heard more than once "So it's like a PC version of Siri?" I have never used Siri but from what I have heard of it, yes, it is supposed to be like that. It is basic and easy to use with an interface and commands ideal for most users, however it also contains advanced commands and features for those of us more "techy"; read more about the commands and features of JARVIS in the <b><u><a href="jarvis_documentation.htm">Documenation</a></u></b>.</p>
		<p>The idea for JARVIS (Just Another Rather Very Intelligent System) came from Tony Stark's DLA Jarvis (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) in the movie Iron Man [2008]. JARVIS will probably never be as capable or understanding as the one in the movie, but it is still a useful program and a fun project. It is my goal that, eventually, he may become a full artificial intelligence.</p>
