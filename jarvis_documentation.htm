		<p>The commands here are listed in alphabetical order, you can use the table of contents below to quickly navigate to a specific command.</p>
		<p>Each command has a compatability section, it will tell a color coded compatability level for each operating system. <span class="c3">Red</span> means it is not compatable, <span class="c2">blue</span> means its compatability hasn't beed tested, <span class="c1">green</span> means it is compatable.</p>

		<h3 id="#0001">afirmation</h3>
		<p>This command must be used in conjunction with the <a href="#0000">toggle</a>, <a href="#0000">on</a>, or <a href="#0000">off</a> commands. When used with <a href="#0000">toggle</a> it toggles the afirmpref variable with a value of 1 meaning the afirmation is turned on and a value of 0 meaning the afirmation is turned off. This variable is saved in the jarvis.ini file. It dictates whether JARVIS will say "i am sorry, i didnt understand that, try again" when you say a string that contains no commands. When used with the <a href="0000">on</a> command, the afirmpref variable is set to 1 regardless of what its value was before. When used with the <a href="0000">off</a> command, the afirmpref variable is set to 0 regardless of what its value was before.</p>

		<h2 id="#futureadditions">Future Additions</h2>
		<p>This section just contains ideas that I would like to incorporate into JARVIS in futre updates. I will be working on the following ideas:</p>
		<p>A JARVIShome program that would act like a home that can control many aspects of JARVIS, you would be able to send JARVIS commands (which would solve that pesky "I have lost communication with JARVIS and he is in 'hide' mode" problem), run all the tools, easily manage your schedule, reminders, timers, and alarms, edit the settings variables more easily, and ultimately make JARVIS easier to use.</p>
		<p>Give JARVIS the ability to learn what programs you have installed on your computer and run them by voice. This could be done by reading the registry or looking the the Start\All Programs folder.</p>
		<p>Fix the 'timer' command so that you can ask for timers that are after midnight (this will be done by giving JARVIS its own timer to keep track of), and allow you to use a conjunction of two or more time measurements.</p>
		<p>Add 'reminder' and 'schedule' commands.</p>
		<p>Give JARVIS the ability to search for and play music files by voice.</p>
		<p>Give JARVIS the ability to switch between windows using an "Alt-Tab" like function.</p>
		<p>Give JARVIS the ability to use the 'transparency' command on all running programs instead of just itself.</p>
		<p>Add a 'macro' command that lets JARVIS record and recreate keystrokes and mouse movent.</p>
		<p>Add a messenger type protocal to JARVIS and the server that allows a user to say, for example, "Tell John I said hi." Then John's JARVIS would tell John, "Zack says hi". This would also encompass the creation of a type of address book for your friends JARVIS id's, and an id system run by the server.</p>
		<br />
		<p>If you are knowlegable in QB64 and would like to help on any of these ideas for future updates, please send me an email from the <a href="jarvis_contact.htm">Contact Section</a>.</p>
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<p>If you have any questions about something that is or isn't in the documentation, or would like to send a compatability report for a command, please send me an email from the <a href="jarvis_contact.htm">Contact Section</a>.</p>
