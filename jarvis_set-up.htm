		<br />
		<p>This section will walk you through step-by-step how to set up you JARVIS for the first time.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Step 1</h2>
		<p>The first thing you have to do to start using JARVIS is to choose and download the download that is right for your computer. If you have never installed a previous JARVIS then you want to download a full package, if you have, then follow the patching instructions for on the <a href="jarvis_downloads.htm">Downloads</a> section. All the downloads can be found in the <a href="jarvis_downloads.htm">Downloads</a> section.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Step 2</h2>
		<p>Wait for the download to finish and then run the msi installer package. Allow it to run if you are asked. [***Add more here when you make the packages***]</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Step 3</h2>
		<p>After it is finished installing JARVIS will be run for the first time. This first run will add shortcuts to your desktop and start menu, create lists of necessary files and backups for your JARVIS, move certain tools into your system folder (if you are concerned about what is being moved into your system folder, look <a href="jarvis_faq.htm#">here</a>), and update you PATH variable to allow JARVIS and its tools to run more cleanly. Now JARVIS will welcome you and you can begin using this utility, however I would recommend you do a few other things so you are able to use JARVIS most effectively. The following steps go over processes that will make your experience with JARVIS much easier and more enjoyable.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Step 4</h2>
		<p>Close JARVIS and go to Control Panel. If you have XP, click on Speech and make sure that you have your speech recognition as Microsoft English Recognizer v5.1 or higher. You can download Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10121">here</a>. If you need to, download and install it before continuing.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Step 5</h2>
		<p>Go to Control Panel. If you have XP, click on Speech, and if you have Vista or 7, click on Ease of Access and then Speech Recognition. Now click on Train Profile and read the passages it gives you, this lets the system learn your voice and allows it to understand you better. By training your profile you can optomize your speech recognition.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Step 6</h2>
		<p>Now you can run your JARVIS and use it with ease. To learn how to use your JARVIS and different commands, go to the <a href="jarvis_documentation.htm">Documentation</a> section.</p>
